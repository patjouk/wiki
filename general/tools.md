# Tools

We use various tools to help us stay on track and do things for us. We believe that tools are awesome and there is absolutely no reason to write a single line of code if someone else can do this for us. Here is a list of tools we use, and what do we use it for.

## Megiteam

Megiteam generously sponsored our email. We use it for creating accounts for each event (city@djangogirls.org), and aliases (city@djangogirls.com -> city@djangogirls.org). Their web client is not the best, so we usually just use email clients or forward all corespondence to our gmails. 

Login details are in Meldium.

## Trello

We use [Trello](http://trello.com/) for managing tasks and assignements. Our main Trello board is the one public for everyone: [Django Girls Trello](https://trello.com/b/q7p6jcfg/django-girls). We use it for almost all tasks. 

Make sure to always assign yourself to thing you've comitted yourself to do, and move the card to "in progress" or "done" to let others know that things are happening. 

There are also three private Trello boards:
- [Django Girls Awesomeness Ambassador and Support Team board](https://trello.com/b/MhTXkuii/django-girls-support-team) -- for all the task where the Ambassador needs help from the Support Team. You can also tasks that don't need to be public: boring bureaucracy or a task that could hurt or put at risk Django Girls, Django Girls Foundation, or any person involved in Django Girls.
- [The Awesome To-Do list ;)](https://trello.com/b/3QtRXvcP/the-awesome-to-do-list) -- the aim of this board is to help the Ambassador stay organized. It's a list of all the tasks the Ambassador is working on (columns "Next things to do!" and "In progress"). It's also a brain dump organized by topic (documentation, website, community, etc) to keep tracks of what needs to be done.
- [Events calendar](https://trello.com/b/nWNEA8bf/events-calendar) -- connected to `sync_events_dashboard.sh` on PythonAnywhere. Use this board to check if organizers are on schedule. Use the red label if an event is not happening and yellow is something wrong is happening (for example: organizers really late and not responding).

## Slack

[Slack](http://slack.com/) is our real time communication channel, and you can read more about how we use it in the [Start Sparkling Guide](sparkling.md).

Slack is also used by all of our organizers, supporters and friends of Django Girls. There is no general rule who can be there, but we want to keep it safe for everyone to express their ideas, so be mindful about that. Only the Support Team has the permission to invite others to Slack.

## GitHub

[GitHub](http://github.com/) is our main documentation / code sharing tool. All of our repos are public and you can find them [here](https://github.com/DjangoGirls).

## Google Drive

We use one shared Django Girls folder to manage our files. Basically, every single file we create should end up there, in a proper folder. If you put it in the folder, it's gonna be automatically shared with the whole team. 

Make sure to notify us that you put a new file there if you want us to know about this, because Google Drive doesn't send a notification about this.

## Mailing lists

We use various mailing lists (on Google Groups) to make it easier for us to communicate in a big group. [Read more about mailing lists here](mailing-lists.md).

## Gitbook

[Gitbook](http://gitbook.io/) is a tool we use to publish [Tutorial](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/), [Organizer's Manual](http://organize.djangogirls.org), [Coaching Guide](http://coach.djangogirls.org), [Tutorial Extensions](https://www.gitbook.com/book/djangogirls/django-girls-tutorial-extensions/details) and [Translation Guidelines](http://translate.djangogirls.org).

The Gitbook books are linked to Github via webhooks, so whenever something is commited to master, the book will rebuild itself automatically. At Gitbook you can go in "Activity" tab to see all builds of the book.

It's also handy to install Gitbook locally if you want to test some bigger PR to the tutorial before uploading it to Gitbook.

## Crowdin

[Crowdin](http://crowdin.com/) is our tutorial translation tool. To be honest, we haven't quite figured it out yet. 

## Meldium

[Meldium](http://meldium.com/) is where we keep all of our passwords for services that doesn't support adding members to accounts. 

**You should keep your Meldium password really safe!**

## Tumblr

[Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/) is what we use as our blogging platform. 

## PythonAnywhere

[PythonAnywhere](http://pythonanywhere.com/) hosts our djangogirls.org website.

## Campaign Monitor

[Campaign Monitor](http://djangogirls.createsend.com/) is a tool we use for newsletters and marketing campaigns. We've got a template that we always use there.

## CloudFlare

[CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com/) is our DNS, and they also give us SSL for free :)
